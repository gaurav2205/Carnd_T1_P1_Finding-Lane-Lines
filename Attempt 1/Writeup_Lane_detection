**Finding Lane Lines on the Road**

The goals / steps of this project are the following:
* Make a pipeline that finds lane lines on the road
* Reflect on your work in a written report

### Reflection

### 1. Describe your pipeline. As part of the description, explain how you modified the draw_lines() function.

My pipeline consisted of 5 steps. First, I converted the images to grayscale, then I blurred the image using gaussian blur algorithm. I then used canny edge algorith to detect the edges, then i selected the region of my interest in the image following which , i drew line using hough algoeithm in the region of interest and then pasting that lines on the original image.

In order to draw a single line on the left and right lanes, I modified the draw_lines() function by first calculating the slope, constant and length of all the detected lines on the left side and right side by filtering according to positive and negative slopes.After that I took a weighted average on both side to get slope and constant for a single left lane and right lane. Then I drew that line using the edge values for y axis and the calculated slope and constant of left and right line. 

If you'd like to include images to show how the pipeline works, here is how to include an image:

### 2. Identify potential shortcomings with your current pipeline


One potential shortcoming would be what would happen when sharp curves comes.

Another shortcoming could be when there is a sharp change in the hsv values in a video ( like an image in the sun)


### 3. Suggest possible improvements to your pipeline

A possible improvement would be to improve line detection algorithm and having a better averga slope and constant

Another potential improvement could be to to use hsv filters in addition for line detection in order to avoid misdetection of lanes.
